Description: 'HDF5' (Hierarchical Data Format 5) is a high-performance 
    library and file format for storing and managing large, complex 
    data. This package provides the static libraries and headers for 
    the 'HDF5' 'C' library (release 1.14.6). It is intended for R 
    package developers to use in the 'LinkingTo' field, which 
    eliminates the need for users to install system-level 'HDF5' 
    dependencies. This build is compiled with thread-safety enabled 
    and supports dynamic loading of external compression filters. 
    'HDF5' is developed by 'The HDF Group' <https://www.hdfgroup.org/>.
